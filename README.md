# Welcome to Flutterkeys! 

This is an AAC *(augmentive alternative communication)* app being created by a nonspeaking AAC user named Pheonix.

Pheonix would like to partner with a nonprofit to get a fee waiver when the app is ready for beta testing & release.

The goal of this project:
- is to provide a hybrid of symbol and typing based AAC.
- the app should be robust and highly customizable.
- it should align with values of accsess and openness.

---

## How will Flutterkeys meet these goals?

### Symbol + Typing Hybrid:
- Symbol supported boardsets & system keyboard accsess.
- Keygaurd compatable with the iOS system keyboard (QWERTY).
- Message window is a regular text feild.
    - allows moving the cursor via direct select,
    - allows selecting text within the message window and using the context menu,
    - while typing: preserves accsess to autoccorect and autocapitalization (if enabled),
    - while typing: preserves accsess to keyboard shortcuts, personal dictonary and text replacment settings,
- Keyboard does not cover the grammer, message, or navigation rows & their functions remain accssessible.
- Navigation buttons automatically hide the keyboard. 

---

### Robust:
- Planned pre built vocabulary of over 4,000 words.
- Full array of features.
    - speak on select, buttons that override speak on select settings, 
    - grammer/inflector buttons,
    - history,
    - search button,
    - and more!


---

### Customizable:
- App color scheme
- Fonts
- Buttons (color, label, message, symbol, boarder, border color, font, speak on select, ect)
- Boards (planned options for various layouts, creating from a template, infinite number of boards, ect)
- Boardsets (multiple boardsets, option for a blank boardset, plan for multiple pre built options)
- Languages (can pick multiple languages, with unique voices for each language) 
    - voices are limited by what is on the device, and what the app is allowed to use
    - prebuild boardsets + grammer buttons are english only (But- I would accsept & appreciate help in changing that)


---

### Accsess and Openess:
- 100% free
- Open Source voice options (*because companies shouldn't get to own our voices*)
- Import and export voices (must be in compatible format)
- Import and export boards & boardsets (must be in compatible format)
- Exporting includes the image files
- Plan for supporting .OBF format
- Android & iOS (likly to also be on web, windows, linux, and macOS)
- Somewhat multilingual
    - fonts in multiple scripts
    - language code wrappers to use multiple languages in one sentance with complete control 
    - language slider to change what your default speaking language is
    - per language voice setings
