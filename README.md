# Welcome to Flutterkeys! 

This is an AAC [augmentive alternative communication] app that was created by a nonspeaking AAC user named Pheonix.

Pheonix struggled to accsess robust AAC apps because of their cost, and none of these apps were designed in a way that met Pheonix's needs. So, after realizing no one else would build it for them, they began learning to code. 

This app is not yet completed, but should be functional. Currently Pheonix is working to impliment Piper TTS as an option in the app after having their voice deleted by Apple. RIP Aaron. 

Pheonix would like to partner with a nonprofit when the app is ready for beta testing & release so that iOS users can download Flutterkeys for free. 

To contact Pheonix, email them at: [Pheonix@michaeljohnclark.com] 

### Disclaimer: 

I (Pheonix) have entireley learned to code working on Flutterkeys. I started this project (and therefore coding) less than 2 years ago (it is currently December 2025). I started in Swift UI, I learned the absolute bare minimum in playgrounds before starting on Flutterkeys. I moved to Flutter several months ago, and did no "how to use flutter" prep. I have learned Flutter ONLY through this project. My learning curve is visible, and while I have built this entire code base (and I am very proud of myself for that!) I don't know much of the technical language behind what I have done, and don't know how to do anything that isn't in this project. I also do not consider myself a computer person, and don't understand GitHub very well.
