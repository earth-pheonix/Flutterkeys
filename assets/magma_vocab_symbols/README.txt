// Volunteers donated symbols under the following conditions:

(I/Me/My refer to Pheonix Clark- the developer of FlutterKeys)
(You/Your/Yours refers to the volunteer donating symbols)

"By submitting symbols you consent to me adding them to the apps [FlutterKeys] symbol library. 
This library will be used in the app.
I may use symbols from it to promote and educate about the app and AAC in general. 
I may share the library so users can use the same symbols their AAC app does in other tools 
Examples of other tools include but are not limited to, communication cards, visual schedules, social stories 
I may also use the images to create and share these kinds of tools. 

Images cannot be used commercially. They cannot be included in producs that return profit. 

My app may eventually include a built in image editor. By having your symbols in the app if this feature occurs, you agree to let your images be edited. 

It’s not feasible for me to list exactly what words I sourced from where.  So Your name will not be directly tied to the symbols you make. 
You will be credited for the symbols by having your name listed as one of the artists/ symbol sources.  You will also go in my extra special thank you credits for volunteering to make symbols the app specifically needs. 

Feel free to do whatever you want with the symbols you submit. Sell them, submit them to symbol libraries like AACil, whatever. 
You are not giving up ownership via submitting them here. 
You are simply giving me permission to use and share them following the terms I just described. 
These are your symbols, this is your art."
